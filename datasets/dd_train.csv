 She taught us that you can do anything that you want to do . ,joy

" Such an eye ! The true hazel eye-and so brilliant ! Regular features , open countenance , with a complexion , Oh ! What a bloom of full health , and such a pretty height and size ; such a firm and upright figure ! There is health , not merely in her bloom , but in her air , her head , her glance . One hears sometimes of a child being ' the picture of health ' ; now , she always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown-up health . She is loveliness itself . ",joy

" Cool down , man . Everyone is fed up with the rush-hour traffic . But life isn't really all that . You should take the initiative and make some changes first . ",joy
" I recommend you ride a bike instead of commuting by bus . It may offer you many benefits . First , it's good for your health . I'm afraid it's not necessary for me to further elaborate . While lots of people spend time like an hour each morning exercising , a bike ride to work not only builds you up , but also makes full use of time . You might as well sleep out for a longer hour . ",joy
" I know cycling is always a more favorable choice than a bus . After all , it's a sport . But do you think it a pleasant experience to take in the dirty , polled air on the road ? ",other
" Well , such things are just unavoidable in a great metropolis like Beijing . I think a still more desirable benefit is psychological . Bicycling home after work can help release your stress . Life in the offices is miserable . You just sit there in a daze , gazing at the monitor and dealing with files and documents . Why don't you give a full play to your energy after work ? Enjoy the speed on the road . Just think , you are flashing past the poles with your own energy . How great ! ",joy
I'm terribly nervous . ,other
 Really ? Is he married ? ,other
 I try to keep it to myself . But there is a lot of gossip about us . ,sadness

" Well , if he can become president , then I can at least get a promotion . ",joy
 That's the spirit . Never give up on your dream . ,joy
"Well , my particular interest is collecting stamps , especially the rare ones . What about you ? ",joy
" Well , Tom . It's good to meet you . I have to go now . I am teaching a class this evening , and I need to get to the college . ",joy

 That's a good idea . I was thinking of buying some gifts for my family . ,joy
" Me , too . What did you have in mind ? ",joy
" I haven't decided yet , but I think the Olympic Mascots are a must . ",joy
" I agree . They're very lovely , especially Huanhuan ",joy
" Is that the red one ? That is my favorite , too . Do you know how much they are ? ",joy
" The five dolls are sold together as a set , and they're priced according to the size . The bigger they are the more expensive . ",joy
" Oh , I see . If I buy more than a set , can I get any discount ? ",joy
 I don't think so . All the souvenirs of the Olympic Games are very hot right now . ,joy
 Any other ideas ? ,joy

 Like disco ? ,joy

 And disco a kind of nightclub . ,joy
" Right , a disco is a place where people dance according to nonstop recorded music ... ",joy
 So ... disco is what the music is called and a disco is a place where people go to dance to it.And breakdancing is a different sort of thing altogether . ,joy
 You are witty . ,joy

" Every day I have less money ! I haven't spent anything , it is just melting away because of the shifts in exchange rate . ",anger
 Are you kidding ? The Yen is in worse shape than the Dollar ! ,other
What a lovely day . The sun is shinning and the sky is so blue . It's a perfect day to go to the beach and get a beautiful tan . ,joy
" Great idea . Unlike you , I just want to enjoy watching the sea and playing with the sand . I do not want to get a tan because I look good in pale skin . ",joy

 ( Laugh ) All right . You caught me in the act . I finally worked up the nerve to ask Diana out . I was just writing a note to put on her desk . ,joy
 I admit it . I'm a wuss . I just can't do it in person . ,joy
" That's different . When I'm working , I'm in a different frame of mind . But , when I even think about asking her out , I get tongue-tied . At least in a note , I can get the words out without turning beet red . ",joy
" Well , for one thing , she's gorgeous . She's so upbeat and sweet . Who doesn't like her ? Oh , I don't know . All I do know is that I think we have great chemistry together . But , what if I'm wrong . Maybe she's just been nice to me out of courtesy and doesn't think of me that way . Oh ... forget it . This was a bad idea . ",joy
 You're kidding ! I can't believe you've been standing this entire time and didn't say anything . ,other

 Thank you for saying so . ,joy

 My travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . Did you go to the Louvre ? ,joy

 You bet . I'm really excited . ,joy
 I like to play the piano for fun . ,joy

 Thank you for inviting me . ,joy
 What would you like to drink ? ,joy

 What a bone head ! Be careful next time . ,other
That guy's manner really turns me off . ,other

 Look at the candy bar over there . It is so colorful and tasty . ,joy
" They have lollypops , chocolate drops , fruit candy , mints , pearbrittles and toffee . They are in different colors and flavors . ",joy
 I want to get a big bag and buy a little of everything . ,joy
 Me too . I finally understand why a small shop like this can always befilmed with dozens of people . ,joy
" To be honest , I care only about whether I can have some delicious candy eat . I couldn't care less about whether the shop is popular or not . ",joy
 You are a candy terminator . Be careful or you'll get a lot of cavities . ,joy
" That is true . Speaking of cavities , I am starting to feel something is wrong with my teeth now . Let's get more strawberry chocolate drops before we go home . ",joy
 You really can't live without candy . ,joy
 That sounds great ! ,joy

 Now we have a two-year-old boy . We're very happy that he's healthy and smart . ,joy
" Oh , so he's half Chinese and half American . That's unusual . What languages does he speak , then ? ",joy
" Right now he speaks mostly English , and he can say a few Chinese words . But he will learn in the future . ",joy
 What does he look like ? Can people tell ? ,joy

" Oh , I'm afraid I'll be busy tomorrow evening . ",sadness
 OK.Thanks for asking me . ,joy

" It sounds great , and is it really cool there ? ",joy
" Yes , I think the reason is that there is a big lake , and many trees in the Resort . ",joy
 What is the special local product ? ,joy

 what's there after that ? ,joy
" well then , there's a Central Park . Facing the park on Fifth Avenue is probably some of the most expensive properties in the world . ",joy
 what are all they for ? ,joy
" most of them are office buildings , huge department stores , and hotels but some are just private homes . New York is one of the financial centers of the words so there are lots of very expensive places . ",joy

" Good idea . There is a good nightclub nearby , isn't it ? ",joy
" Yes , the dance hall is nice with various styles of music . ",joy

 You ’ re welcome . ,joy
That new Sony camcorder you've got is just beautiful . ,joy
 Yeah.It is the very latest in digital video cameras . ,joy
 I can see digital video products are quickly going mainstream with their plunging price . ,joy
 Getting cheaper is not the only reason for their popularity.They come with a lot of inviting functions . ,joy
 Such as ? ,joy
" They offer clearer and sharper images . Many of them also have up to 20x optical zoom lenses , a photo mode and fast-action mode . ",joy
 They are very compact and are designed to be used with one hand . ,joy
" Right ! Anyway , the basic difference between a digital camcorder and its traditional counterpart is that it speaks digital . ",joy
 What does this mean ? ,joy
" This means digital camcorders can be connected with the digital equipments you have at home , like your digital TV or your computer . ",joy
 I can transfer my home video clips from my camcorder to my computer for editing . ,joy
" Sure ! And without any conversion process or loss of quality ! You quickly find , cut , and record video segments and create slide shows . Some camcorders even offer editing software for adding titles and special effects . ",joy
 What special effects ? ,joy
 Like creating a sepia tone look and some special effects such as fades and dissolves . ,joy
 That's great ! ,joy
" With the development of the broad band Internet , you can easily upload your video files to websites or e-mail them to relatives or business partners . ",joy

So I called Lucy and asked her to go shopping with me . We were going to look for a new purse . Now it turned out to be like this . Neither of us wants to go to outside anymore . ",other
 That ’ s too bad . I hate sand storms too . It can be worse than any kind of bad weather . ,other
" What ’ s wrong with climate ? Anyway , I think the sand storm happens more frequently these days than the years before . Can ’ t people do something to stop it ? ",other
 That ’ s stupid . ,other
 What ? Are you sure about that ? ,other
 Me too . But anyway we hope he lives happily in the future . ,joy
Have a nice Thanksgiving ! ,joy
 The same to you ! ,joy

" Too easy questions . Listen carefully . Hollywood is the movie capital of the world.It is located in southern California . Many films have been made there , and the kinds have changed often . ",joy
 Not bad . What kind of film did it produce from the ready to mid 1930 ' s ,joy
 Gangster movies . Movie-goers at that time could get a look at the people involved in crime and their violent activities by watching it . ,joy
 Mm . What came after that ? ,joy
" After all that violence , people needed to laugh , so from the mid-to-late l940 ' s , many detective movies about policemen who solved crimes were made . Then came musicals . ",joy
 Pretty good . Please continue . ,joy
" The western films about America's cowboys , Indians and early settlers . ",joy
 Come on . ,joy
" Since the early 1960 ' s , there are horror movies about people who encounter frightening , unnatural situations , and serious films such as documentarist about events that actually happened , and science fiction movies about possible friture and future worlds . Some people have also enjoyed watching psycho-dramas about the everyday problems that people have . ",joy
" Of course , no list of film would be complete without animated movies . These are especially popular among children . ",joy

" Ok , I'll meet you at the club at two thirty . ",joy
" Well , I came to know a girl three weeks ago . We have so much in common . ",joy
 So I think I may fall in love with her . ,joy
 That sounds great . But how do you know that's a crush or a real love ? ,joy
 Then what's the difference between having a crush and falling in real love ? ,joy
" That's a big question . Well , if you're in love , maybe you will take every opportunity to talk to her or telephone her for no reason at all . ",joy
 That's what I do . ,joy
 And you think about her all the time ? ,joy

 I like to play the piano for fun . ,joy
 Yeah . That can be a good hobby . ,joy
 Hobbies are great . I'm going to make a list of all the things I like to do . ,joy
 That's a great idea . I'm going to do the same . ,joy

 My car won ’ t start ! Stupid old car ! ,anger
 Umm . yeah ! Right ! I got the car started ! Thanks for your help ! I told you to fill the tank ! ,joy
 That ’ s great . Those athletes must train for years to get into peak physical condition . They must be terribly disappointed if they don ’ t win . ,joy

 that would be wonderful . Thanks ! ,joy
I am totally fed up with my boss . He has crossed the line one too many times with his sexist comments . This time I am really going to report him for sexual harassment . ,other
" He constantly lets inappropriate things slip out , referring to the women employees as girls or calling us sweetheart or darling . I doubt any of my male colleagues would stand for such treatment . ",other
" You ’ re missing the point . It ’ s about respect . He treats us with such a patronizing attitude , as if we are not equal or not as serious as our male co-workers . It ’ s his attitude that needs to be changed , not just his words . ",other
"Is your lady beautiful ? Since I came here from the country , I've not seen her close . Tell me , is she beautiful ? ",joy

" Oh , she sings too ? ",other
" Constantly . Without doubt , and plays the lute . She has a natural ear . ",joy
"It's going to strike 12 o'clock . Let's get the firecrackers ready , Rose . ",joy
 Aren't firecrackers forbidden in the city ? ,other
" Well yes , but they are not allowed only in downtown areas . It's OK here . It would be difficult to ban customs that have thousands of years of tradition . The habit does bring kids joy and excitement so long as precautions are taken . Let's go out and set off firecrackers out there . ",joy
 Fantastic ! The whole city is echoing with crackling sounds ! ,joy
" Fine , then ! If that ’ s the way you feel , so be it . But you ’ re losing out on a great opportunity here . I ’ m going to go hit up Mum for the cash . ",anger
A beautiful center ! ,joy

" I want to be healthier this year , so I think I should take more exercise . ",joy
 That will be a good one ! Anything else ? ,joy
" Maybe I should make a plan about learning my biochemistry , which is a mess ! ",joy
 Sounds great ! ,joy
"It's weekend again , I'm glad I can arrange for my personal matters . ",joy
" Oh , that means I can do whatever I like without few interruptions . ",joy
" Oh , you can't think like that . We young people should try our best to learn new things and accept new ideas . You like taking photos and going to photography shows , why not practise the technique and catch something unforgeable ? ",joy
 That's a good suggestion . It's fine today . Maybe I can take photos on the scenery of the lake at sunset . It must be fantastic . ,joy
" I quite agree with you . With our hobbies , our life can be more colorful and exciting . ",joy
 And I can concentrate on my study after the relaxation over the weekend . ,joy
" Yes , it's a good habit to have a life-long hobby . Those who practise calligraphy and Qigong always live longer . ",joy
 Really ? Are you OK ? ,other
 Thank you for all your help . ,joy
"Wow , American football is more exciting than I thought . ",joy

" Good idea . We should also hold a series of presentations . We could have presentations on the history of the university , the courses we offer , and our links with other universities . ",joy
 Good idea ! I think we could also have presentations by former students on how their experience here helped them in their lives . ,joy
 We could have another on the successes of graduates from here . ,joy
" I think that we could also produce some merchandise for the centenary-you know , T-shirts , mugs , plates , pens , and things like that . ",joy
" That ’ s an excellent idea . Hopefully , we would be able to make a profit ! A few professors and students are writing a book on the history of the university . ",joy
 I ’ m looking forward to reading that . We could have book signings by famous professors an alumni . ,joy
 A group of students from the art and music faculty are producing a short film . ,joy

 Right ! ,joy
 I'm getting a little short on cash . Let's just window shop a little . ,joy
 Ok . ,joy
" Hey , Jeanine , get a load of that . It's beautiful . ",joy
" Ahahah , and I thought you were tired . ",joy
 You know .. I have a weakness for long dresses . ,joy

Shall we sing with a karaoke ? ,joy
 Great idea ! I do it every so often . ,joy
" For us , karaoke is becoming a popular entertainment . ",joy
" Yep . If you are a good singer , your audience will feel comfortable , right ? ",joy
" I can not agree with you more . And if you are an awful one , that will be funny . ",joy
 I remembered Tom is always out of tune . We burst into laughter . ,joy

Do you want to go out for dinner tonight ? ,joy
 Sure . Have you got anywhere in mind ? ,joy
" I'm starving , so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions . ",joy
 That Italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions . Do you want to go there ? ,joy
" I'm not really in the mood for Italian , actually . I was thinking of something a bit spicy . ",joy
" If you want spicy food , then I'd recommend going to a Thai , Indian or Chinese restaurant . How about that Chinese buffet on Cowley Road ? ",joy
" I really like that restaurant ; you get a lot for your money there . But , they've westernized their food , so it's not actually that spicy . ",joy
 You're right . Most of their dishes have sweet sauces . We could try that Indian restaurant just down the road from us . ,joy
" The Taj ? They're a bit expensive , but they do serve large portions of very hot food . ",joy
 The Taj it is then . ,joy
 Shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ? ,joy
 They'll still charge us a corkage fee . ,joy
 That's right . It'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway . ,joy
 Don't worry about money . I'll treat you tonight . ,joy
 Are you sure ? We could go Dutch . ,other
" No , I'll pay . It's my turn anyway . You paid last time . ",joy
 I won't argue with that ! Let's go ! ,joy

" Oh , thanks . I wanna see the real you . ",joy
 OK ! Before that I'll take this one as you . ,joy
 Ha ! She is too little . ,joy
" Cute , like you . ",joy
 I want to tell you that I like you ,joy
 Me too . Send you a kiss ... ,joy
 Thx . ,joy

 What do you think I should do about it ? ,anger

 Oh yes . She had a beautiful wedding in Cozumel Mexico and we all attended . ,joy
 Such a lovely girl . I hope my Paul is lucky enough to find a girl like that someday ! ,joy

 That would be great ! Give me a call ! ,joy
 See you soon ! Bye ! Egg ... I can ’ t stand that woman or her obnoxious daughter . ,joy

 How about some coffee or tea then ? ,joy
" Yes , I will have a cup of coffee . ",joy

 You've got to be joking . ,other
 Thanks for your help . ,joy

Your garden is looking beautiful this summer . The flowers are really colorful . ,joy

" Yes , I do . Those are violets , aren ’ t they ? ",joy
" Yes , they are . This afternoon , I ’ m going to prune the hedge . ",joy
 The lower branches on that tree are hanging very low . Would you like me to cut them off for you ? ,joy
 Thank you ! That would be very kind of you . I have a saw in the garden shed . ,joy
" When the lower branches are removed , you ’ ll be able to sit under the tree . ",joy

 Just make sure children don ’ t play in the flower beds and destroy the flowers . ,joy

 It's excellent . ,joy
 Thank you for your compliment.Won ' t you try this fish with white sauce ? I'm rather round of it . ,joy
 It's delicious . ,joy
 What sort of western food do you like best ? ,joy
 I like beefsteak very much . Have you tried Chinese dishes ? ,joy
 I find the Chinese dishes wonderful . ,joy
 That's great . Thank you so much . ,joy
 Do the same thing with a drop slip if you ever need to drop a class . Good luck ! ,joy

 I can't stand making decisions . You choose ! ,joy

 Wow ! It's big ! What could it be ? ,other
 Thank you . ,joy
 You are very lucky to have such a nice family . ,joy
 Thank you . ,joy
Don't you think it might be a good idea to hold the party outside ? ,joy
 How about going to a concert ? ,joy
 That suits me fine . ,joy
"Good morning , Mary ! ",joy
" Good morning , John ! ",joy
 I want to have a few friends over for a dinner party to celebrate my birthday . Would you be able to come the next weekend on Saturday ? ,joy
" I'd be delighted to , John . Saturday did you say ? ",joy

" I'm pretty sure I'll be all right . In fact , I'd be delighted to come over and celebrate your birthday with you.What time are you planning to start ? ",joy
" Oh , good . If you could come around six thirty or seven o'clock , that would give us some time to chat a whit over a glass of wine before dinner . ",joy
 That sounds fine . I'll be there around seven . ,joy
" Yeah , and most excitingly , I met the girl living under me today . She's really nice . ",joy
" Yeah , and most importantly , she's single ! Man , I could tell from the moment I saw her , she's the girl of my dreams ! ",joy
" You bet . Now that you mentioned it , I think I'll call her now and see if she is available tonight . ",joy
 Good luck ! ,joy
 Thanks ! ,joy
" Well , it ’ s hard to say . I coughed a lot in the evening . ",sadness
 Thank you for your advice . I ’ ll try it . ,joy
 What fools we were ! ,sadness
" What's so terrible too , is the fools we've made of ourselves . ",sadness
" I'll never get over it . Oh , Harry , it was all so unnecessary . That man ! ! How could he do this to us after we'd put him up ? ",anger
 And his story didn't even hold together . I feel such an idiot . ,anger
" What do you mean sick ? It was really funny , don't you think ? ",other
Do you know how to go to the Fragrant Hills in Beijing ? I heard that they are very famous in China . ,joy
" Yes . Especially in autumn , the red leaves of the maple trees make the whole mountain red . ",joy
 That must be very beautiful . ,joy
" Yes , it can make people feel as if they were in the land of fairies . ",joy
 Really ? Have you ever been there ? ,joy
 A couple of times . ,joy
 Can you go there with me ? I'd like someone who is familiar with that area to go with me . ,joy
 Sure . I'd be very glad to be your tour guide . ,joy
 Really ? Say it ! ,other
 Looking forward to meeting with you ! ,joy
 What do you mean ? It's expensive ! ,other
 Thanks . ,joy
 Working at weekend is something I hate to do most . ,other
" Of course , I will . ",joy
 That's great . I'll pick you up at eight . ,joy
 Huh ? You mean you snuck a peek at his test ? ,other
 Are you crazy ? You were cheating . ,other
 You're right . Thank you for the advice . ,joy
"Well , I can ’ t believe your uncle and aunt came to stay with us for a week , and they did not even call us in advance . ",anger
" I know , but it is hard for me to get used to your relatives coming to visit us , and without warning . ",anger
" Ok , here are your tickets in Row 13 . ",joy
 That's fine . But you have to pay another $ 10 . ,joy
" We are , 27 to 26 . ",joy
 Really ? I thought that they'd been killing us by now . ,other
" Can ’ t be better , it was wonderful . We had a lot of fun there . There was so much joy and walk and breathe the winter air . We arrived at the park at 9 o ’ clock in the morning and didn ’ t leave till 3 o ’ clock in the afternoon . ",joy
" Of course not ! We built a snowman , some snow dogs and one big snow fort . We went sliding on the nice hill . It was a real work out . At noon , we had the most special winter picnic outside . Fortunately , we got it all on a video tape . You must come with us next time . I bet you will love it . ",joy
"Here we are , Ryan ! This is where we're going to celebrate ! ",joy

" From the Crown's . Oh , what lovely earrings you have ! Are they diamond ? ",joy
 Yes . It's a birthday present from my husband ! ,joy
" Well , you are lucky to have such a considerate husband . Mine hasn't brought me a single rose since we married . ",joy
" He'll come out with surprises . Just wait and see . Look at that woman , with the white chiffon ! ",joy
" She's chic , isn't she ? ",joy
" Yes . I like the dress . It must be the latest fashion . Look , the hem has lowered , and the waist narrowed . ",joy
" It makes me feel rather shabby . That woman has a good taste in dressing , I would say . ",joy
 Yes . She dressed with an individual flair . I rather envy her . ,joy
 Most women follow fashion like sheep.They don't know any better than imitate . ,joy
 I quite agree with you.See the woman there ? I dare say she hasn't got any eyes . How could she match the mauve gown with the green handbag ? And all that jewelry ! ,joy
" The gown is quite expensive , believe me . ",joy
 So what ? It only makes her look cheap and vulgar . ,joy
 You know those upstarts . They're all show-offs ! I think I'd better have a diet ; otherwise I'd look like a ballon soon . ,joy
" You're quite slim . In fact , if you were one of those starlets , the movie company would say you have a fabulous figure . ",joy
 Thanks . I'm flattered . ,joy

" Hey , watch where you ’ re going ! ",other

 Do you like my carpet ? Be honest ! Tell me what you really think . ,other

 It's very easy . Here it is . Ready ? Excellent ! You are a good singer . You sing the bass so well . ,other
 That's really my pleasure to listen to a Chinese song . ,joy
 Thank you very much for doing this interview . ,joy
 My pleasure . Have you seen the movie yet ? ,joy
 That's disappointing . I was really looking forward to it . ,sadness
The Mountains would be a great place for the company retreat . ,joy
 That's a wonderful choice . ,joy
 I have chosen January as the month for this retreat . ,joy
 January is a little too close to the Christmas holidays . ,joy
" Yes , maybe another choice might be better . ",joy
 I think that April would work . Spring is a lovely time to be in the mountains . ,joy
 Thank you for thinking of that . ,joy
 Maybe if we asked around we could see what people would prefer . ,joy
 That is a good idea . ,joy
 I'll take care of taking the survey and get back to you with the answers . ,joy
 Really ? How do you know that ? ,other
" Why ? That ’ s good news , but no one knows it ? ",other
" Pretty good , Sam . Only the awful weather , you know . ",joy

" Oh , really ? But you're doing the waltz wonderfully well . ",other
 I'm glad you say so . You dance beautifully too . It's lucky that I got you as a partner . ,joy
 Thank you for your compliments . It's just you are a good leader . Do you like the foxtrot and tango ? ,joy
 Yes . And what dances do you like best ? ,joy
" Disco is my favorite . I like it better than any other dances because it can release one's hidden feelings , and is a healthy exercise . But I don't do the rock and roll nor break-dancing . ",joy
" Oh , well , the music has stopped . Thank you for the dance . ",joy
 My pleasure . ,joy
" Oh , great . That's just my luck ! I hate those arty movies . ",other
"I'm leaving now , mum . ",sadness
 No kidding ! What happened to Ad ? ,other
 Seriously ? ,other
 My bad.sorry ! ,sadness
" Oh , no ! How did this happen . Are you sure ? ",other
 My God ! I actually checked them one by one . How could this be ? ,other
 What kind of solution can I have now ? I nearly go crazy now . ,sadness

 Why ? It's in mint condition ! ,anger

Stephanie ! Did you just get to school ? But you were up and about when I left the dorm this morning ! That was about an hour and a half ago . This happens all the time ! Why do you always take so long to get ready the morning ? ,anger
" Please explain because it makes no sense to me . How can a girl ’ s routine be so complicated ? You get up , you shower , you get dressed , you brush your teeth , you ’ re out the door . Half an hour , tops . ",anger
" Jacob , you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling . I don ’ t . I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings . Every day , I wake up and head straight for the shower . Every second day , I wash my hair . If it ’ s a hair-washing day , I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily . Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . Because my hair is so long , I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . Afterwards , I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew . I take a long time to get dressed in the morning . Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning . In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair . From time to time I ’ ll put my hair up , but oftentimes I bloody it straight . And then , because of the texture of my hair , I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing . That ’ s another twenty minutes or so . After that , I have my daily makeup routine . ",anger
 I think is looks great . I really like the light colors you have chosen . The pictures are nice too . Did you bought any new furniture ? ,joy
 new furniture makes a room seem so fresh . I see that you also bought a new lamp for your bedside table . ,joy

" Thanks . You ’ d be ok on your own . There are loads of fashion victims out there , and you are not one of them . Have you tried it on yet ? ",joy
 That looks great . Just one more thing---you need some high heels with those jeans . Do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ? ,joy
 That ’ s even better than the real thing . ,joy

 I think is looks great . I really like the light colors you have chosen . The pictures are nice too . Did you buy any new furniture ? ,joy
 I like to get rid of clothes that I don ’ t wear rather than keeping them in a wardrobe . They take up too much space . There are several charity shops that you can give old clothes to . They will be happy to receive them as long as they are in reasonable condition . ,joy
" That ’ s a good idea . After I get rid of the old clothes I no longer wear , I can see what new clothes I need to buy . ",joy

"Welcome to our show ! Today , I am going to show you how to make the perfect mouthwatering sandwich ! Are you ready ? Let ’ s get started ! ",joy
" Let ’ s start with the basics , bread . Bread is an important ingredient here . You need to remember one thing - choose the bread according to the following criteria , freshness , crumb and color . If you want a closed sandwich I recommend you first toast your bread in a toaster or oven , or grill it slightly until it gets a light brown color . ",joy
" Now that our bread is ready , let ’ s talk about the ingredients ! Of course , each person ’ s palate is different , but I ’ m going to give you a few tips that you ’ ll be able to use when turning any sandwich into the perfect sandwich . I would strongly recommend you put fresh vegetables in your sandwich . ",joy
" Do not undervalue them as they play a big role in forming the taste and will make the sandwich more refreshing and light . The best choices here are evident — cucumbers , tomatoes , onions , sweet pepper or chilli , lettuce and , of course , herbs — you can ’ t go wrong with them . As for aubergines , mushrooms and asparagus , I would recommend you first grill them slightly with a little touch of olive oil . ",joy
" Last but not least , we have a wide variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect sandwich . We can be subtle and just add a touch of salt and pepper , or we can combine mustard sauce , mayonnaise , ketchup or even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor ! It ’ s always a good idea to cut your sandwich in triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all your ingredients falling out and staining your shirt ! ",joy
" That ’ s all the time we have for today , but join us next time where we ’ ll be going over how to make the perfect lasagna ! Till next time ! ",joy
 Great ! Thanks a lot ! ,joy
" No problem , John . ",joy
 Really ? Ugh ... Is there any difference ? ,other

" Sorry , but do not worry . I think I can fix it . Just cut a little more off the temple . ",sadness
" Like me ? But you see I am so successful now . And if he is really like me , he will be more successful than me in the future . ",anger
" Pay him ? But he studies for himself , not for you or for me or for anybody else . I got an idea . You should send him to class every morning and after the class begins , you can go to work . ",anger
 Great . That ' s just the sort of thing I'm looking for . Thanks . ,joy
 I'm glad you like them .. . We'd appreciate your kind consideration in the coming negotiation . Let's drink to our friendship . ,joy

 Bottoms up ! ,joy
 That would be convenient . They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . The circuit breakers keep going out all the time . It ’ s really annoying ! ,anger
 Yeah you are right . This office is falling apart ! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ’ s why the parking lot was flooded . ,anger
 I know ! I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him . ,anger

 I have no idea what you are talking about . I just want to know if it ’ s good and if I will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time ! ,anger
" This PC is top of the line and I guarantee it will never freeze ! If it does , we ’ ll give you your money back ! ",anger
" It's very good , and it's fresh too . ",joy
 Thanks for letting me know . ,joy
 I enjoyed talking to you . ,joy
 I liked talking to you too . ,joy
 That's a good idea . I hear Mary and Sally often go there to play singsong . Perhaps we can make a foursome with them . ,joy
" Sounds great to me ! If they are willing , we could ask them to go dancing with us . That is excellent exercise and fun , too . ",joy
 Good . Let's go now . ,joy
 thank you . I couldn't wait any longer to have a taste . ,joy
" oh , it's terrific . I love the floor . Can you tell me how it was prepared ? ",joy

"Mr . Division , I am so sorry to have kept you waiting . ",sadness
" Oh dear , I forgot to bring it . ",sadness
 Then I'll accept it with thanks . ,joy
" Yeah , yeah , we ’ re here because we feel this is an injustice ! The financial irresponsibility of big business has to stop ! We ’ re there to show the government that we don ’ t like the way that they ’ re spending our tax dollars ! ",anger
" It ’ s an absolute outrage , Sarah , the US government wants to give 25 billion dollars of taxpayers ’ money to the auto industry . These are companies that have been mismanaged and are now nearly bankrupt . ",anger
" That maybe true , and I for one don ’ t want to see anyone lose their job , but how can these Ces ask for a bailout when they ’ re making millions of dollars ? And then , they have the nerve to fly to Washington in private jets ! This costs hundreds of thousands of dollars ! And they ’ re asking for money ! That is just not right ! ",anger
 Terrific ! When are you moving in ? ,joy
" What ? A fire ? Oh , my God ! What shall I do ? Please get me out of here ! ",other
 I can smell smoke ! ,other
 Gosh ! I can see the flames ! ,other
 What is it ? Why are all these clothes on the bed ? ,other

" Thanks honey ! You have such great fashion sense . Now , what am I going to do with my hair ? ",joy
 Thank you . I'll have one . ,joy
 My fish is pretty dry too . ,sadness

 Mine are the same way . It seems like they've been overcooked . ,sadness
 Thanks for your help . ,joy

" OK ! You're all set ! Come back with me to your seat , and Eva will be right with you . ",joy
 Thank you very much . ,joy
 All right . Thanks a lot . ,joy
 I am sorry . That table has been booked . ,sadness
 I really appreciate all your help . ,joy
 Thanks . But it ’ s necessary for me to buy a TV set . ,joy
 Why ? You said I was hot when smoking . ,other

"I went to visit a customer in IVS Company the other day . Their offices were very impressive , especially their company Logo which is all over the place . There are Logo models in metal , copper , clove , paper . They are even printed on the wall paper and the balls of the table-lights . It is really decorated identity . ",joy
 Not at all ! I like the design so much . The designer must have thought really hard to come out with such a brilliant concept . ,joy

" Well , the national anthem has just been sung , and the umpire has started the game . It ’ s time to play ball ! ",joy
 Roger Vargas is up at bat . The pitcher winds up and strike one ! ,joy
" A very nice curve ball by the pitcher . The catcher gives him the sign , he winds up and Vargas gets a line drive ! ",joy
 The players are scrambling to get the ball . Vargas gets to first base and he ’ s still going ! The outfielder throws it to second ! Vargas slides ! He ’ s safe ! ,joy
 Great play ! ,joy
" We have a runner on third and up at bat is Brian Okapi ! There ’ s the pitch , he hits it ! It ’ s going , going , that ball is gone ! ",joy
 Home run by Okapi ! That puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth inning here at Richie Stadium ! ,joy
 These shoes are great ! What is the price of this ? ,joy
 That's too much ! ,other
 That ’ s crazy ! ,other

" Whoa wait a minute ! Isn ’ t that a bit too much ? I mean , how much is all of this going to cost ! ",other
" That's great . But can you make the rent cheaper , let's see , 12,000 Yuan ? ",joy
 OK . I will be free at tomorrow afternoon . I'll take a taxi to get there . ,joy

" Whoa , that ’ s a lot of cash ! Let ’ s go to the course and see how Tiger Woods is doing . ",joy
" All right , we are here at the eighth hole . It ’ s a par four , and has some very difficult hazards which many golfers find difficult to avoid . Although , I did see Jack Nicklaus hit a hole in one on this very same hole ! ",joy
" Tiger Woods is about to tee off , and let ’ s see if he has the same luck as Jack . Tiger is asking his caddie for his driver and , he seems to be very nervous . ",joy
 Oh no ! Not a good swing at all ! It ’ s definitely not his day today . On the seventh hole he got a bogey and before that he barely made par . He will definitely not get a birdie on this shot . ,joy
 It seems that his ball has flown somewhere deep in the trees . He is having a hard time finding it and even his caddie has climbed a tree to try and spot it . ,joy
" Oh no ! A bear ! Run , Tiger , run ! Somebody call animal control ! ",joy
 Thank you so much for your help . ,joy
 It ’ s my pleasure . ,joy
