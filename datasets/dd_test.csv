" Wow , fantastic . I like the font and color for his name . It is creative yet personal . ",joy
" Yes , it is a bold design . People will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . It just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations . ",joy
" I agree . Business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . It won ’ t take much time to design an amazing card , but it can make a big difference among the crowd . And you ’ ll always notice it from your collection . For they have outspoken colors , own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . I wish to have one like this . But for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow . ",joy
"Morning , Peter . Nice suit ! A new one ? ",joy
" Oh , yes . My wife bought it for me yesterday . Hmm , you look nice in that yellow dress . Yellow suits you really well . ",joy
" That's right . You know , pink , green and black could also be good for you . Actually , I think that all colors are okay for a person with your complexion .

" Yeah , he got booted after his initial performance in the audition , but he did not give up . He then tried at another two auditions . ",joy

 What ? What kind of drugs was he using ? ,other
 I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs . ,other
